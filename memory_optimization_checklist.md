  - [x] count(): Efficient document counting. Enables fast monitoring of data growth and system health.
  - [x] psutil memory usage monitoring: Tracks memory usage in real time, preventing OOM errors.
  - [x] Memory usage alerts: Notifies operators of high memory, allowing preemptive action.

  - [x] Streamlit cache_resource: Caches models in Streamlit apps for fast, memory-efficient reuse.
  - [x] Model loading status tracking: Provides visibility into model readiness and loading issues.
  - [x] HuggingFace cache management: Prevents disk bloat and ensures up-to-date models.

- [x] P4: Create vector store service
- [x] P5: Implement memory-efficient storage
- [x] P6: Plan regular defragmentation

## Phase 3: Advanced Optimizations
- [x] Caching and Performance
  - [x] Query result caching: Reduces redundant computation, improving speed and lowering cost.

  - [x] Memory cleanup routines: Prevents memory leaks and long-term bloat.
  - [x] Periodic maintenance: Automates cleanup and optimization, reducing manual intervention.

- [ ] Memory-Efficient Storage
  - [x] FAISS evaluation: Ensures best backend for memory and speed.
  - [x] **FAISS PQ compression** ([P1], Completed)
    - Status: Implemented and evaluated
    - Summary: FAISS Product Quantization (PQ) compression is now supported in the vector store. PQ reduces index size by more than 50% with only a minor drop in accuracy. Add/search times and memory usage are similar to uncompressed FAISS and Annoy. 
    - Evaluation: On 1,000 documents (dim=384), PQ index size was 0.92MB (vs. 2.01MB for flat FAISS), accuracy 0.4689 (vs. 0.4727), add time ~10.5s, search time ~0.012s/query.
    - Caveats: PQ requires the number of training vectors to be much larger than the number of centroids (m*256). For best results, use at least 10,000 training vectors. Accuracy may drop with aggressive compression (high m, low nbits).
    - Usage: See documentation and example in the codebase for how to enable PQ compression in FAISSVectorDB.
  - [x] Flat FAISS index: Maximizes accuracy and speed for current data.
  - [x] Index maintenance: Keeps vector search fast and reliable.

    - Rules: Only local/test/cache databases can be purged. Persistent main database (D:/DATA) is protectedâ€”purge attempts raise PermissionError and are logged.
    - Tests: Verified correct purging and protection logic. Windows file lock issues may affect test cleanup but not production use.

2. [ ] Extract task requirements and expected behaviors: For each uncompleted task, parse the description to identify expected behaviors, requirements, and any referenced function names or keywords.
3. [ ] Search codebase for candidate implementations: Search the codebase for candidate functions or code blocks that could fulfill the requirements of each task, using both function names and behavioral clues (e.g., docstrings, comments, or related keywords).
4. [ ] Analyze candidate functions for functional match: For each candidate, analyze the function's docstring and body to check for the presence of all required behaviors (such as logging, error handling, metrics tracking, API usage, etc.).
5. [ ] Handle name/functionality mismatches: If a function's name is different but its implementation matches the requirements, record this mapping and explain why it is a valid match.
6. [ ] Report partial matches and gaps: If a candidate function only partially fulfills the requirements, generate a detailed report specifying which parts of the checklist description are implemented, which are missing, and what changes are needed for full compliance.
7. [ ] Assign priorities to truly uncompleted tasks: For tasks with no matching implementation, assign a numerical priority value based on their order in the checklist.
8. [ ] Generate a detailed evaluation report: Output a comprehensive report for each task, including match status (full, partial, or none), references to code, missing/extra parts, and required changes.
9. [ ] Update checklist with results: For each task that is fully matched, automatically mark it as complete in the checklist and append a reference to the relevant function and file. For partial or unmatched tasks, update the checklist with the evaluation findings and assigned priority.
