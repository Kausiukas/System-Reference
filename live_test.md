### 5.1 Phase 1: System Status & Database Validation (8 minutes)

⚠️ **Expected Issues During This Phase:**
- Performance Monitor will show 'dict' attribute errors every 2 minutes
- Only 9/15 agents will be confirmed active
- Some database views may be missing (warning expected)
- Need to identify 6 missing agents for full ecosystem validation

#### Step 5.1.1: Database Connection & Schema Test
```bash
# Run system readiness validation
python validate_system_readiness.py

# Expected: All checks pass
# ✅ Environment configuration
# ✅ PostgreSQL connectivity  
# ✅ Database schema validation
# ✅ Agent registration system
# ✅ Performance metrics system
# ✅ Health monitoring system
```

#### Step 1.2: Agent Registration Verification
```python
# Check registered agents in database

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] System readiness validation passes (⚠️ expect database view warnings)
- [ ] All 15 expected agents registered (Current: Only 9/15 confirmed)
- [ ] Database operations functional
- [ ] No critical connection errors (⚠️ Performance Monitor errors expected)

**Document Results:**

}
```

### 5.2 Phase 2: Agent Coordination & Background System (10 minutes)

⚠️ **Expected Performance:**
- Agent Coordinator should successfully manage lifecycle
- 4 core agents (Coordinator, Health, LangSmith, AI Help) confirmed active
- Performance Monitor will show errors but remain active
- May need to investigate status of Enhanced State Monitor and Self Healing Agent

#### Step 2.1: Launch Background Agents System
```bash
# Start the complete agent coordination system
python launch_background_agents.py

# Monitor startup in separate terminal

- [ ] Performance metrics being collected
- [ ] No critical system errors
- [ ] All 7 agent core features validated and functional
- [ ] System coordination health above 85%

}

### 5.3 Phase 3: Dashboard Validation & Real-time Monitoring (12 minutes)

⚠️ **Expected Dashboard Behavior:**
- Health score should display around 84.0/100
- 9/15 agents active (some marked as unknown status)
- Performance Monitor section may show errors or missing data
- Business Intelligence should display basic metrics

#### Step 5.3.1: Launch Monitoring Dashboard
```bash
# Start the Streamlit dashboard
streamlit run background_agents_dashboard.py

# Dashboard will be available at:
# http://localhost:8502 or http://localhost:8503
```

#### Step 3.2: Dashboard Components Verification
**Manual validation in browser:**
- [ ] **System Overview**: Health score displayed (expect 50-70 during startup)
- [ ] **Agents Table**: All 7 agents listed with status and capabilities
- [ ] **Agent Details**: Click on agent names to view detailed information
- [ ] **Performance Charts**: Real-time metrics visualization
- [ ] **Business Intelligence**: Cost and revenue impact sections
- [ ] **Configuration**: Database and monitoring settings displayed
- [ ] **Auto-refresh**: Page updates every 30 seconds automatically

#### Step 3.3: Real-time Data Validation
```python
# Generate test data for dashboard
python -c "
import asyncio

    print('✅ Test system events generated')
    print('🔄 Check dashboard for updated data')

asyncio.run(generate_test_data())
"
```

#### Step 3.4: Dashboard Performance Test
**Check in browser:**
- [ ] **Load Time**: Dashboard loads within 5 seconds
- [ ] **Data Updates**: New test data appears in charts
- [ ] **Responsiveness**: Page responds to user interactions
- [ ] **Error Handling**: No browser console errors
- [ ] **Mobile View**: Dashboard responsive on mobile devices

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Dashboard loads successfully on ports 8502/8503
- [ ] All major components render correctly
- [ ] Real-time data updates functional
- [ ] No critical rendering errors

**Document Results:**
```json
{
  "phase": "dashboard_validation",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-08T21:22:00Z",
  "dashboard_load_time_seconds": 3,

### 5.4 Phase 4: Performance & Business Intelligence Testing (10 minutes)

⚠️ **Modified Approach Due to Known Issues:**
- Skip detailed Performance Monitor testing (data structure errors)
- Focus on LangSmith Bridge (confirmed working well)
- Test Heartbeat Health Agent (stable)
- Validate basic business intelligence metrics

python -c "
import asyncio

from dotenv import load_dotenv

### 5.5 Phase 5: Integration & Stress Testing (10 minutes)

⚠️ **Stress Testing Considerations:**
- PostgreSQL should handle concurrent operations well
- Watch for memory issues due to Vector Store concerns (TODO.md)
- Monitor for additional agent instability during stress
- Focus on stable agents for stress testing

#### Step 5.1: Database Connection Pool Stress Test
```python
# Test concurrent database operations
python -c "
import asyncio
from background_agents.coordination.postgresql_adapter import PostgreSQLAdapter
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import time

load_dotenv()

async def stress_test_database():
    # Create multiple adapters to test connection pooling
    adapters = []
    for i in range(10):
        adapter = PostgreSQLAdapter({
            'host': os.getenv('DB_HOST', 'localhost'),
            'port': int(os.getenv('DB_PORT', 5432)),
            'database': os.getenv('DB_NAME', 'background_agents'),
            'user': os.getenv('DB_USER', 'postgres'),
            'password': os.getenv('DB_PASSWORD')
        })
        adapters.append(adapter)
    
    start_time = time.time()
    
    # Perform concurrent operations
    tasks = []
    for i, adapter in enumerate(adapters):
        # Mix different operation types
        tasks.append(adapter.log_heartbeat(f'stress_test_agent_{i}', {'stress_test': True}))
        tasks.append(adapter.log_performance_metric(f'stress_test_agent_{i}', 'load_test', float(i * 10)))
        tasks.append(adapter.log_system_event(f'stress_event_{i}', 'Stress test event', 'info'))
    
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
    end_time = time.time()
    
    successful = len([r for r in results if not isinstance(r, Exception)])
    errors = len([r for r in results if isinstance(r, Exception)])
    
    print(f'Stress test results:')
    print(f'  Concurrent operations: {len(tasks)}')

    print(f'  Errors: {errors}')
    print(f'  Time taken: {end_time - start_time:.2f}s')
    print(f'  Success rate: {(successful/len(tasks)*100):.1f}%')
    
    if successful >= len(tasks) * 0.9:  # 90% success rate
        print('✅ Database stress test PASSED')
    else:
        print('❌ Database stress test FAILED')

asyncio.run(stress_test_database())

#### Step 5.2: End-to-End System Workflow
```python
# Test complete system workflow
python -c "

    # 3. Performance metrics
    await adapter.log_performance_metric('e2e_test_agent', 'test_metric', 75.5)
    print('✅ Step 3: Performance metrics')
    
    # 4. System event logging
    await adapter.log_system_event('e2e_test', 'End-to-end test completed', 'info')
    print('✅ Step 4: System event logging')
    
    # 5. Data retrieval and validation
    agents = await adapter.get_all_agents()
    heartbeats = await adapter.get_recent_heartbeats(minutes=1)
    metrics = await adapter.get_performance_metrics(minutes=1)
    events = await adapter.get_system_events(minutes=1)
    
    end_time = time.time()
    
    print(f'\\n📊 End-to-end workflow results:')
    print(f'  Total time: {end_time - start_time:.2f}s')

    print('🎉 End-to-end workflow COMPLETED')

asyncio.run(test_end_to_end_workflow())
"
```

#### Step 5.3: System Recovery Test
```python
# Test system resilience
python -c "
import asyncio
from background_agents.coordination.postgresql_adapter import PostgreSQLAdapter
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

async def test_system_recovery():

        'database': os.getenv('DB_NAME', 'background_agents'),
        'user': os.getenv('DB_USER', 'postgres'),
        'password': os.getenv('DB_PASSWORD')
    })
    
    # Simulate error conditions and recovery
    try:
        # Test with invalid data
        await adapter.log_performance_metric('recovery_test', 'invalid_metric', None)
        print('⚠️ Invalid data handling test')
    except Exception as e:
        print(f'✅ Error handling working: {type(e).__name__}')
    
    # Test normal operation after error
    await adapter.log_performance_metric('recovery_test', 'valid_metric', 50.0)
    print('✅ System recovery: Normal operation restored')
    
    # Test connection recovery
    connection_ok = adapter.test_connection()
    print(f'✅ Connection status: {\"HEALTHY\" if connection_ok else \"FAILED\"}')
