- Inefficient onboarding of new developers

### Solution
An AI-powered assistant that combines:
- **Enhanced RAG System**: 95% operational with ChromaDB + SentenceTransformers
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: PostgreSQL-based system with 9/15 agents active
- **Intelligent Document Processing**: 150+ files, 25,000+ lines indexed
- **Conversation Memory**: Persistent learning across user sessions
- **PyNarrative Visualization**: Character-driven narrative visualizations
- **Repository Upload System**: Universal repository analysis
