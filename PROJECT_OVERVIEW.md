# Project Overview: Memory-Optimized Vector Database System

## Problem Definition
Our project addresses a critical real-world problem: **Memory optimization and performance monitoring in AI-powered vector databases**. This is particularly relevant as AI applications scale and handle larger datasets.

### Problem Statement
- Vector databases often face memory bloat, performance degradation, and reliability issues as they scale
- Lack of comprehensive monitoring and automated recovery mechanisms
- Difficulty in maintaining system health and performance over time

### Solution
We've built a comprehensive system that:
