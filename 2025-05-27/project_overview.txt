📘 Application Overview: Client Profile Builder

Client Profile Builder is a smart assistant designed to help sales teams and account managers automate the process of:

    Extracting information from client communications (emails, PDFs, notes),

    Building and maintaining structured client profiles,

    Tracking sales journey stages,

    Suggesting next actions based on context,

    Automatically generating personalized email drafts.

It combines LangGraph for workflow orchestration, OpenAI for natural language understanding, ChromaDB or FAISS for vector search, LangSmith for runtime observability, and Streamlit for the user interface.
🔧 Key Features
📨 1. Email & Document Ingestion

    Supports .msg, .txt, and .pdf files

    Extracts structured data and stores it in temporary memory

    Prepares content for chunking and vectorization

🧠 2. Vector-Based Contextual Memory

    Retrieves relevant past communications and notes from a long-term vector store

    Ensures continuity and deep personalization

📋 3. Structured Client Profile Generation

    Builds/upgrades JSON-based profiles containing:

        Company name, contacts, needs, sentiment

        Sales stage, last action, suggested next step

    Supports continuous enrichment as new data comes in

📈 4. Sales Status Tracker

    Tracks clients across key sales stages:

    Logs every execution step with full traceability

    Enables performance review, debugging, replay

    Links shown inside Streamlit UI for fast access

📊 8. Visual Workflow Representation (Mermaid)

    Mermaid diagram displays the entire workflow graph

    Enhances user clarity and system explainability

    Dynamically viewable in the Streamlit frontend

🧱 Core Components
Component	Description
LangGraph	Orchestrates stateful workflow as a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)
LangChain Tools	Provides LLM and tool chaining capability for reasoning and generation
OpenAI	Provides summarization, classification, generation, and reasoning
ChromaDB/FAISS	Stores and retrieves long-term knowledge in vector form
Streamlit	Web frontend for upload, run, review, and visualization
LangSmith	Tracks each workflow run, showing input/output/state trace for each step
Client Folder Structure	Each client has their own folder with content.txt, profile.json, and embeddings/
🧰 LangGraph Node Descriptions
Node ID	Function
export_emails	Downloads/loads new emails from Outlook or file system
preprocess_and_chunk	Extracts and cleans text, splits into chunks, embeds
search_memory	Searches client vector DB for relevant past context
summarize_status	Generates current summary of client's situation
update_profile_state	Writes/updates client_profile.json with new data
track_sales_status	Sets or updates the client’s sales pipeline stage
suggest_next_step	Suggests most appropriate next action (call, offer, reminder, etc.)
generate_email	Produces email copy based on current profile and next action
save_and_notify	Saves output files, displays them in UI, links to LangSmith trace
🔄 State Management

    Short-Term Memory: Transient state passed between LangGraph nodes

    Long-Term Memory: Client’s history embedded into vector database

    Persistent Profile: JSON file storing structured client metadata

💻 User Workflow

    Upload one or more client communication files

    Trigger Workflow via Streamlit

    LangGraph executes: reads, embeds, summarizes, profiles

    LangSmith records trace of all nodes and outputs

    Results displayed: client profile, suggested next step, and email draft

    User can review/edit/send email manually or automate dispatch
