## 📊 Expected Analysis Results

### **Example Integration Assessment:**

```
🔬 Code Integration Analysis: custom_monitor_agent.py

Integration Feasibility: HIGH
System Fit Score: 87.3%
Improvement Potential: $120.00

Integration Analysis:
The CustomMonitorAgent follows excellent patterns for integration into the background agents system. Key findings:

✅ ARCHITECTURE COMPATIBILITY:
- Properly inherits from BaseAgent (line 5)
- Implements required initialize() and execute_work_cycle() methods
- Uses shared_state for PostgreSQL integration
- Follows async/await patterns consistently

✅ INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS:
1. Database Schema: Add 'custom_monitor_agent' to agents table
2. Configuration: Add agent to launch_background_agents.py
3. Monitoring: Integrate with heartbeat health system
4. Dependencies: No additional libraries required

✅ IMPLEMENTATION STEPS:
1. Add agent class to background_agents/monitoring/
2. Update system_initializer.py to register agent
3. Add configuration entry to config/monitoring.yml
4. Run database migration for new agent type
5. Test agent startup and health monitoring
6. Validate metrics collection and storage

⚠️ CONSIDERATIONS:
- Monitor memory usage with metrics_buffer growth
- Implement buffer size limits for production use
- Add error handling for metric collection failures
- Consider adding alert thresholds for critical metrics

🎯 BUSINESS VALUE:
Expected to improve system monitoring coverage by 25%, providing early detection of performance issues and reducing downtime by an estimated 15 minutes per month.

Confidence: 89% | Quality Grade: A | Processing Time: 1.4s
